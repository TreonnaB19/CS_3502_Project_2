## Description

This is a Java-based console application that simulates and evaluates CPU scheduling algorithms. The simulator is designed for academic purposes to study and compare advanced CPU scheduling techniques.

Implemented Algorithms:
- üîÅ **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)** ‚Äì A preemptive algorithm that selects the process with the shortest remaining time.
- üîÑ **MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)** ‚Äì A dynamic, multi-level scheduling strategy that adjusts process priority based on execution behavior.

## Features

- Simulates CPU scheduling using different algorithms
- Tracks and reports the following metrics:
  - Average Waiting Time (AWT)
  - Average Turnaround Time (ATT)
  - Response Time (RT)
  - CPU Utilization (%)
  - Throughput
- Displays results in a formatted table
- Modular design for adding new scheduling algorithms
- Designed for console-based interaction

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Command Line / Terminal
- Object-Oriented Design Principles
